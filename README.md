# Predictive-Modeling-for-Salary
This project contains research and code related to predictive modeling for salary categorization of employees. The research aims to address the challenge organizations face in effectively categorizing employee pay as high, medium, or low. A fair and balanced compensation system is essential for employee engagement and organizational performance. The study explores the use of various predictive models, including logistic regression, random forests, decision trees, and naive Bayes, to predict employee salary categories based on multiple independent variables
